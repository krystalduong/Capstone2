The music industry is a turbulent place. Artists who once dominated the charts fall out of favor, while newcomers may unexpectedly take the stage. There never seems to be a definite pattern, and no matter what anyone knows, it's nearly impossible to predict which songs will make the cut.
With that in mind, knowing which songs are popular on Spotify and the characteristics of those songs, we will be able to find correlations algorithmically that will provide a little more certainty when predicting the next 'hit'.
Using data from Spotify, can we predict how long a song will stay on charts?
